Developer Guide
===============
To start using the MapStore geOrchestra project as a developer you need the following:

 * install the needed requirements:
     * NodeJS (>=8)
     * JDK (>= 8)
     * Maven (>= 3.x)

 * clone the GitHub repository:

 .. code-block:: console

    git clone --recursive https://github.com/georchestra/mapstore2-georchestra

 * from the cloned source, install the dependencies from the npm registry:

 .. code-block:: console

    npm install

 * do a full build using the build script:

 .. code-block:: console

    ./build.sh


.. toctree::
   :maxdepth: 4

   ./integration/index


Configuring the backend
-----------------------

To develop locally you will need to use a proxied backend. To configure your backend of choice you need to properly change the webpack.config.js file,
in particular you need to change the following variables:

 * DEV_PROTOCOL: http or https
 * DEV_HOST: host and port of the backend

 .. code-block:: javascript

    const DEV_PROTOCOL = "http";
    const DEV_HOST = "localhost:8080";


You can either:
 * use an online backend
 * deploy and run your just build backend on a Tomcat instance

To deploy your local backend you will need to:

 * copy the mapstore.war from web/target to your Tomcat webapps folder
 * create a local geOrchestra datadir anywhere in your PC and copy the following inside it:

  * a standard geOrchestra ``default.properties`` file with generic configuration (database and LDAP settings for example)
  * the datadir/mapstore folder from web/target/geOrchestra with the mapstore specific configuration files
  * add the georchestra.datadir environment variable to the Tomcat setenv script to point to your datadir folder

 .. code-block:: console

    -Dgeorchestra.datadir=/etc/georchestra

 * properly change the configuration files, in particular to set the database and LDAP repository connection settings

If you don't have a local database and LDAP repository properly configured for geOrchestra you can use remote ones.
Remember: to use a local backend both a PostgreSQL database and LDAP repository needs to be available and properly populated.

Developing the frontend
-----------------------

To start the frontend locally, just run:

 .. code-block:: console

    npm start

Your application will be available at http://localhost:8081

Mocking security
----------------

When working locally you won't have the security proxy authentication enabled, but you can simulate it using a specific
Chrome extension called ModHeader.

Install this extension and configure it to set the following request headers:

 * ``sec-username``: the username logged in
 * ``sec-roles``: a semicolon delimited list of roles (e.g. ROLE_MAPSTORE_ADMIN)

Remember to disable the extension when you don't need it.
