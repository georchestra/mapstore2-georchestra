Configuration Guide
===================

geOrchestra MapStore can be configured using the `geOrchestra configuration directory <https://github.com/georchestra/datadir>`_.

All basic configurations for the database are already configured and loaded from the ``default.properties`` file inside the root of the configuration directory.

The configuration directory sub-folder ``mapstore``, related to MapStore, contains several files dedicated to basic settings, integration with geOrchestra, application configuration and advanced setup.

In this documentation you will learn how to configure in detail the ``default.properties`` entries and the files in the ``mapstore`` folder.
